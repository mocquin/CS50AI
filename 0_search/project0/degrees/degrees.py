def shortest_path(source, target):
    """
    Returns the shortest list of (movie_id, person_id) pairs
    that connect the source to the target.

    If no possible path, returns None.
    
    
    Complete the implementation of the shortest_path function 
    such that it returns the shortest path from the person with 
    id source to the person with the id target.

    Assuming there is a path from the source to the target, your 
    function should return a list, where each list item is the 
    next (movie_id, person_id) pair in the path from the source 
    to the target. Each pair should be a tuple of two ints.
    
    For example, if the return value of shortest_path were 
    [(1, 2), (3, 4)], that would mean that the source starred in
    movie 1 with person 2, person 2 starred in movie 3 with person 
    4, and person 4 is the target.
    If there are multiple paths of minimum length from the source 
    to the target, your function can return any of them.
    If there is no possible path between two actors, your function 
    should return None.
    You may call the neighbors_for_person function, which accepts a 
    personâ€™s id as input, and returns a set of (movie_id, person_id) 
    pairs for all people who starred in a movie with a given person.

    You should not modify anything else in the file other than 
    the shortest_path function, though you may write additional 
    functions and/or import other Python standard library modules.
